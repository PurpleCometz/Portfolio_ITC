    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This portfolio discusses the types of computer hardware and software including their implementation
        of different institutions in the community.
    </p>

    <h2>Computer Hardware</h2>
    <p>
        It is typically divided into internal and external components. Internal hardware is located inside the computer case and includes 
        components that handle processing power and storage capabilities. External hardware consists of peripheral devices that connect to 
        the computer from the outside to support interaction and expand performance. Refers to the physical, tangible elements of a computer 
        system such as the central processing unit, hard drives, and graphics cards.
    </p>

    <div class="info-row reverse">
        <img src="IMAGES/cpu.jpg" alt="cpu">
        <div class="info-text">
            <h4>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h4>
            <p>
                is responsible for guiding your computer as it processes data, much like a brain guides a body. 
                The speed at which it does this is known as ‘clock speed’ and is measured in gigahertz (GHz).
                It manages and coordinates most tasks the computer performs.
            </p>

            <h4>Motherboard</h4>
            <p>
                is the main circuit board that connects all internal computer components. It allows communication 
                between the CPU, memory, storage devices and other hardware parts.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="info-row reverse">
        <img src="IMAGES/ramstick.jpg" alt="ram">
        <div class="info-text">
            <h4>Random Access Mmemory (RAM)</h4>
            <p>
                works closely with the CPU and temporarily stores information created by programs so that it's immediately 
                accessible. It’s sometimes referred to as ‘volatile’ memory because this data gets erased every time your computer restarts.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

            <h4>Cooling systems</h4>
            <p>
                prevent hardware from overheating during operation. These systems include heat sinks, which are metal 
                components that draw heat away from processors, and fans, which circulate air to dissipate heat. 
                Liquid cooling systems use circulating fluid to remove heat more efficiently, making them ideal for high-performance systems.

    <h2>What is Software?</h2>
    <p>
        Software is a generic term used to refer to applications, scripts and programs that run on a device. 
        It can be thought of as the variable part of a computer, while hardware is the invariable part.
        It is a set of instructions, data or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks. 
        It is the opposite of hardware, which describes the physical aspects of a computer.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Types of Software</h3>
    <div class="info-row reverse">
        <img src="IMAGES/systemsoftware.jpg" alt="systemsoftware">
        <div class="info-text">
            <h4>System Software</h4>
            <p>
                is the backbone of any computer system. It helps hardware interact with application software 
                and allows the system to function efficiently. The most essential type of system software is 
                the operating system (OS), which acts as a bridge between the computer’s hardware and the user.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="info-row">
        <img src="IMAGES/oas.jpg" alt="applicationsoftware">
        <div class="info-text">
            <h4>Application Software</h4>
            <p>
                consists of many programs that perform specific functions for end users, such as writing reports 
                and navigating websites. It also perform tasks for other applications. Applications on a computer 
                can't run on their own; they require a computer's OS along with other supporting system software programs to work.
            </p>

    </div>
    <div class="info-row reverse">
        <img src="IMAGES/devicedriver.jpg" alt="devicedriver">
        <div class="info-text">
            <h4>Device Drivers</h4>
            <p>
                control the devices and peripherals connected to a computer, helping them perform their specific tasks. 
                Every device that's connected to a computer needs at least one device driver to function. 
                Examples include software that comes with any nonstandard hardware, including special game controllers, 
                as well as the software that enables standard hardware, such as USB storage devices, keyboards, headphones and printers.

        <div class="info-text">
            <h4>Programming Software</h4>
            <p>
                Computer programmers use programming software to write code. Programming software and programming languages, 
                such as Java or Python, let developers develop, write, test and debug other software programs. 
                Examples of programming software include assemblers, compilers, debuggers and interpreters.
