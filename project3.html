        This portfolio explores the differences types of number systems including the uses and importance of number systems.

    <h2>What are Number Systems?</h2>

            <p>
                Are systems in mathematics that are used to express numbers in various forms and are understood by computers.
                A number is a mathematical value used for counting and measuring objects, and for performing arithmetic calculations.
                It is also called the system of numeration and it defines a set of values to represent a quantity.
                There are 4 types of number systems which are binary, decimal, octal, and hexadecimal.

    <h3>Types of Number Systems</h3>
    <div class="info-row reverse">
        <img src="IMAGES/binary.jpg" alt="Binary System">
        <div class="info-text">
            <h4>Binary System</h4>
            <p>
                uses only two digits: 0 and 1. The numbers in this system have a base of 2. Digits 0 and 1 are called bits 
                and 8 bits together make a byte. The data in computers is stored in terms of bits and bytes. 
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="info-row">
        <img src="IMAGES/decimal.jpg" alt="Decimal System">
        <div class="info-text">
            <h4>Decimal System</h4>
            <p>
                consists of 10 digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 and is the most commonly used number system. Using the 
                combination of these 10 digits to form all other numbers. The value of a digit in a number depends upon its position in the number.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="info-row reverse">
        <img src="IMAGES/octal.jpg" alt="Octal System">
        <div class="info-text">
            <h4>Octal System</h4>
            <p>
                uses eight digits: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 and 7 with the base of 8. The advantage of this system is that it has 
                lesser digits when compared to several other systems, hence, there would be fewer computational errors. 
                Digits like 8 and 9 are not included in the octal number system.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="info-row">
        <img src="IMAGES/hexadecimal.jpg" alt="Hexadecimal System">
        <div class="info-text">
            <h4>Hexadecimal System</h4>
            <p>
                uses sixteen digits/alphabets: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 and A,B,C,D,E,F with the base number as 16. Here, A-F of the hexadecimal system 
                means the numbers 10-15 of the decimal number system respectively. This system is used in computers to reduce the large-sized strings of the binary system.

    <h2>The Uses of Number Systems</h2>
        <p>
            In our day-to-day lives we will have to depict/represent
            certain objects with a quantity. The number system
            can be defined as the system which uses particular
            words or symbols for quantifying a given object or
            value. For example, teachers would grade/assign a
            particular numerical value to the examination paper
            depending upon the student’s performance giving us
            an idea about the knowledge and preparation level of
            the student.
        </p>
        <p>
            Number systems represents the specific
            identity that a number possesses on the
            number line and provides it with a
            significant notation. It also represents the
            arithmetic structure of the number and
            helps us in calculating the numbers using
            which we can get a specific number.
        </p>
    <h2>The Importance of Number Systems</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>It helps us keep count of things around us.</li>
            <li>Enables unique/accurate representation of several types of numbers.</li>
            <li>Used for computation in the banking sector.</li>
            <li>Helps us in encrypting data, avoiding hacking and misuse of data.</li>
            <li>Allows easy conversion of numbers for technical purposes.</li>
            <li>It should be noted that every fiber of data gets stored in the computer as a number.</li>
            <li>It enables to keep count of all the things around people. Like how many applesare in the basket, or the number of milk cartons to be purchased, etc.</li>
            <li>It enables the unique and accurate representation of different types of numbers.</li>
            <li>Making a phone call is possible only because we have a proper and efficient number system.</li>
            <li>Elevators used in public places also depend upon number systems for their functioning.</li>
        </ul>
