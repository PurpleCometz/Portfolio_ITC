    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This portfolio explores the differences types of number systems including the uses and importance of number systems.
    </p>
    <h2>Introduction to Motherboards</h2>
    <p>
        Motherboards are the backbone of a computer system, housing essential components. 
        It links and facilitates communication between all of the necessary parts, including 
        the graphics card, storage devices, peripheral devices, CPU (central processing unit), 
        and RAM (random access memory). The system board, is a crucial component that makes 
        sure power and data move smoothly between all parts.
    </p>
    <p>
        It includes connectors, sockets, and slots for the installation of hardware parts. 
        The chipset, which controls data transport between the CPU, memory, and other devices, 
        is also included and it contains the BIOS or UEFI firmware, which aids in loading the 
        operating system and initializes the hardware during startup.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are different types of motherboards, such as ATX, Micro-ATX, and Mini-ITX. 
        When building a small personal computer, modern motherboards also come with built-in functions 
        including M.2 slots for SSDs, network interfaces, audio systems, and USB ports. Without these 
        features your personal computer's space is very cluttered.

    <h3>Types of Motherboards</h3>

        <img src="IMAGES/atboard.jpg" alt="atboard">
        <div class="info-text">
            <h4>AT Board</h4>
            <p>
                popular in personal computers in the 1980s. AT stands for Advanced Technical. 
                These motherboards were a specific size and shape, fitting only in AT computer cases.
            </p>

    <div class="info-row">
        <img src="IMAGES/atxboard.jpg" alt="atxboard">
        <div class="info-text">
            <h4>ATX Board</h4>
            <p>
                are the newer type of motherboard used in most modern computers. ATX stands for the 
                Advanced Technology Extended. These motherboards are the improved version of the older 
                AT motherboards. These ATX motherboards have the specific size and layout.

    <div class="info-row reverse">
        <img src="IMAGES/btxboard.jpg" alt="btxboard">
        <div class="info-text">
            <h4>BTX Board</h4>
            <p>
                known as balanced technology extended, or BTX for short, was created to meet the demands 
                of developing technologies, which ask for higher power consumption and, as a result, produce 
                more heat. In order to focus on low-power CPUs, Intel stopped making BTX boards in the middle of the 2000s.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="info-row">
        <img src="IMAGES/extendedatxboard.jpg" alt="extendedatxboard">
        <div class="info-text">
            <h4>Extended ATX Board</h4>
            <p>
                is designed for both dual CPU and single configuration and has up to 8 RAM slots and has more PCIe 
                and PCI slots for adding PCI cards for different purposes.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="info-row reverse">
        <img src="IMAGES/lpxboard.jpg" alt="lpxboard">
        <div class="info-text">
            <h4>LPX Board</h4>
            <p>
                The output and input ports were relocated to the device's back as the first change, in comparison to 
                previous iterations, and the second change was to add a riser card, which makes it simpler to attach components.
            </p>
        </div>

    <div class="info-row">
        <img src="IMAGES/microatxboard.jpg" alt="microatxboard">
        <div class="info-text">
            <h4>Micro ATX Board</h4>
            <p>
                has less ports and slots as compared to Standard ATX board. This type of motherboard is more 
                suitable for those who don’t want to much connectivity and later upgrades like adding more ram 
                and additional GPU and adding PCI cards.
            </p>

        <img src="IMAGES/miniitxboard.jpg" alt="miniitxboard">
        <div class="info-text">
            <h4>Mini ITX Board</h4>
            <p>
                known as the information technology extended (ITX) has been reduced in size and made smaller 
                than in previous generations in its place. It was created in the 2000s, and it is 17 by 17 centimetres in size.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="info-row">
        <img src="IMAGES/miniatxboard.jpg" alt="miniitxboard">
        <div class="info-text">
            <h4>Mini ATX Board</h4>
            <p>
                the most compact members of the ATX family. They had a small price tag and were made to take up 
                the least amount of space possible. Mini ATX was modified into Flex ATX by Intel between 1999 and 2000.

    <div class="info-row reverse">
        <img src="IMAGES/picobtxboard.jpg" alt="picobtxboard">
        <div class="info-text">
            <h4>Pico BTX Board</h4>
            <p>
                due to their small size when compared to a regular motherboard. Despite the fact that the top half of the 
                BTX is shared, two expansion slots are supported. It is made to satisfy the demands of digital applications, 
                and its distinguishing features include the half-height or riser cards.
            </p>

    <div class="info-row">
        <img src="IMAGES/atxboard.jpg" alt="standardatxboard">
        <div class="info-text">
            <h4>Standard ATX Board</h4>
            <p>
                offers more expansion slots, up to four slots for RAM, Two or sometimes more than two PCIe slots for 
                dual graphics cards and more USB and other ports for connectivity, Also its size gives space in between 
                components for airflow to keep heat in control.
