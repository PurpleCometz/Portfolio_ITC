    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This portfolio explores the differences types of number systems including the uses and importance of number systems.
    </p>
    <h2>Introduction to Motherboards</h2>
    <p>
        Computers exist in a variety of shapes and sizes, each built to do specific jobs based on processor power, memory capacity, 
        and user requirements. From the world's most powerful supercomputers, which do trillions of calculations per second, to common 
        microcomputers such as laptops and desktops used at home or at school, each category serves a distinct purpose. 
        The primary categories are supercomputers, mainframe computers, minicomputers, servers, workstations, and microcomputers. 
        They vary in size, speed, storage capacity, and the intricacy of the activities they can carry out.
    </p>
    <p>
        Supercomputers are being used for large-scale scientific research, whereas mainframes process massive volumes of data for 
        banks and enterprises. Minicomputers were originally used as midrange systems in smaller enterprises, but they have since 
        matured into modern servers. Servers offer resources and manage networks, workstations are sophisticated systems for designers 
        and engineers, and microcomputers are personal devices used on a daily basis. These sorts demonstrate how computers have evolved 
        to satisfy the demands of individuals, corporations, and science in today's digital world. 
    </p>
    <h2>What is a Computer?</h2>
    <p>
        an electronic device that processes data according to instructions provided by software programs. 
        It takes input (data), processes it using a central processing unit (CPU), stores information, and 
        produces output (results) to perform various tasks.

        <div class="info-text">
            <h4>Supercomputer</h4>
            <p>
                the biggest and fastest computers (in terms of speed of processing data). Supercomputers are designed such that 
                they can process a huge amount of data, like processing trillions of instructions or data just in a second.
            </p>

    <div class="info-row">
        <img src="IMAGES/mainframe.jpg" alt="mainframecomputer">
        <div class="info-text">
            <h4>Mainframe Computers</h4>
            <p>
                are designed in such a way that they can support hundreds or thousands of users at the same time. 
                It also supports multiple programs simultaneously.
            </p>

        <img src="IMAGES/minicomputer.jpg" alt="minicomputer">
        <div class="info-text">
            <h4>Mini Computers</h4>
            <p>
                a medium size multiprocessing computer. In this type of computer, there are two or more processors, 
                and it supports 4 to 200 users at one time. Minicomputers are used in places like institutes or departments 
                for different work like billing, accounting, inventory management, etc.

    <div class="info-row">
        <img src="IMAGES/server.jpg" alt="server">
        <div class="info-text">
            <h4>Server</h4>
            <p>
                computers that are combined data and programs. Electronic data and applications are stored and shared in the 
                server computer. The working of a server computer is that it does not solve a bigger problem like a 
                supercomputer but it solves many smaller similar ones.

        <div class="info-text">
            <h4>Workstations</h4>
            <p>
                a computer that requests access to the LAN and switches services to respond to the requests via a switch to 
                perform the dedicated tasks with enhanced features. In the workstation, operations are in the form of business, engineering, etc.

            <h4>Microcomputers</h4>
            <p>
                a standalone and compact computer system with a central processing unit, memory, storage, and also input/output devices. 
                It is designated for small-scale or personal use. It provides processing effectiveness in an insignificant 
                form factor to both people and small enterprises.

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Mini computers are older midrange systems, now largely replaced by servers. Microcomputers are the smallest and most common, designed for individual users.
        Workstations are more powerful than microcomputers, built for professional tasks.Servers have the highest memory and core count, optimized to 
        handle many users and processes at once.
