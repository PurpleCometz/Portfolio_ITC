    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This portfolio explores the differences between data, information, and information systems, 
        highlighting their roles in computing and modern technology.
    </p>

    <h2>What is Data?</h2>
    <p>
        It is composed of raw, unprocessed facts and figures collected through observations, experiments, or measurements. These facts are devoid of context and interpretation, 
        making them the essential building blocks for generating meaningful information.
    </p>
    <h3>Types of Data</h3>
    <h4>Quantitative Data</h4>
    <p>
        are numerical and measurable, dealing with quantities and values that can be expressed mathematically, 
        like an item’s weight, volume, or cost. The two types of quantitative data are discrete and continuous data. 
    </p>
    <h4>Qualitative Data</h4>
    <p>
        is descriptive and non-numerical, focusing on qualities and attributes that cannot be measured with numbers. 
        It’s often subjective and interpretive. There are two fundamental types of qualitative data which is nominal and ordinal data.
    </p>
    <h3>Examples of Data</h3>

    <h2>What is Information?</h2>
    <p>
        It is composed of raw, unprocessed facts and figures collected through observations, experiments, or measurements. These facts are devoid of context and interpretation, 
        making them the essential building blocks for generating meaningful information.

    <h2>Differences of Data and Information</h2>
    <h3>Data</h3>
    <p>
        Defined as unstructured information such as text, observations, images, symbols, and descriptions.
        In other words, data provides no specific function and has no meaning on its own. They are the variables that help to develop ideas/conclusions.
    </p>
    <h3>Information</h3>
    <p>
        Meaningful data that refers to processed, organized, and structured data. It gives context for the 
        facts and facilitates decision making. In other words, information is processed data that makes sense to us.
    </p>

    <h2>What is Information System?</h2>
        <div class="info-row">
        <img src="IMAGES/issupercomputer.jpg" alt="Info System">
        <div class="info-text">
            <p>
                is the study of complementary networks of hardware and software that people and organizations use to collect, filter, process, create, and distribute data. They are 
                combinations of hardware, software, and telecommunications networks that people build and use to collect, 
                create, and distribute useful data, typically in organizational settings.

    <h3>Types of Information Systems</h3>
    <div class="info-row reverse">
        <img src="IMAGES/tps.jpg" alt="Transaction System">
        <div class="info-text">
            <h4>Transaction Processing System</h4>
            <p>
                Transactions are any activity or event affecting the company and include deposits, withdrawals, shipping, billing customers, 
                order entry, and order placement. TPS supports these business transactions.
            </p>

    <div class="info-row">
        <img src="IMAGES/oas.jpg" alt="Office System">
        <div class="info-text">
            <h4>Office Automation System</h4>
            <p>
                comprises computers, communication-related technology, and personnel assigned to perform official tasks. 
                It covers office transactions and supports official activity at every level in the organization, subdivided into managerial and clerical activities.
            </p>

        <img src="IMAGES/mis.jpg" alt="Management Info System">
        <div class="info-text">
            <h4>Management Information System</h4>
            <p>
                are designed to help middle managers and supervisors make decisions, plan, and control the workflow. 
                The MIS pulls transactional data from various Transactional Processing Systems, compiles the information, and presents it in reports and displays.
            </p>

    <div class="info-row reverse">
        <img src="IMAGES/dss.jpg" alt="Decision System">
        <div class="info-text">
            <h4>Decision Support System</h4>
            <p>
                is a management-level, interactive, computer-based information system that helps managers make decisions. 
                The Decision Support System gives middle managers the information necessary to make informed, intelligent decisions.
                It uses different decision models to analyze or summarize large amounts of data into an easy-to-use form that makes 
                it easier for managers to compare and analyze information. Often, these summaries take the form of charts and tables.

            <h4>Executive Support System</h4>
            <p>
                provides greater telecommunication, better computing capabilities, and more efficient display options than the DSS. 
                Executives use ESS to make effective decisions based on summarized internal data taken from DSS, MIS, and external sources. 
                In addition, executive support systems help monitor performances, track competitors, spot opportunities and forecast future trends.
