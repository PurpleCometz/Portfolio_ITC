    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This portfolio discusses, fundamental concepts, the various computing disciplines, 
        and possible majors for students pursuing a computing career.
    </p>
    <p>
        Computer science is the study of computers and computing, including their hardware,
        software, theoretical underpinnings, and applications in information processing. Studying
        algorithms and data structures, designing computers and networks, modeling data and information
        processes, and artificial intelligence are all included in the field of computer science. Since
        computer science has some roots in mathematics and engineering, it uses methods from fields like
        electronic circuit design, probability and statistics, and queueing theory. Similar to more
        conventional fields like engineering, law, and medicine, computing has developed into a separate
        career. It highlights that computers is a science with its own theories, methods, and applications
        rather than only a technology. Although reading and math have always been essential components
        of school, digital literacy is now required in contemporary educational systems. Digital
        literacy is an essential life skill that promotes academic and social success in addition to
        professional readiness. The importance of digital literacy is increasing as technology becomes
        more pervasive in daily life, and students must acquire these abilities in order to succeed in both
        personal and professional settings.
